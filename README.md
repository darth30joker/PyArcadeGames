## Tetris

`tetris_origin.py` is the original version of Tetris game, provided by Arcade examples, link: https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/examples/tetris.html.

I have added a few changes to it:
1. Added `SPACE` key to quickly drop the block to the bottom.
2. Added `ESC` key to pause/unpause the game.
3. Remove white grids

Check out my version with `tetris.py`.
